All Supplementary Materials For Manuscript 
-----------------------

There are two main sections for the supplementary figures.
- Classification evaluation results for all remaining biologically realistic simulation datasets.
- Breakpoint analysis for all biologically realistic simulation datasets.

Above two sections' results are shown in [Classification_analysis](https://github.com/qianfeng2/detREC_program/tree/master/Supplementary_material/Classification_analysis) sub folder and [Breakpoint_analysis](https://github.com/qianfeng2/detREC_program/tree/master/Supplementary_material/Breakpoint_analysis) sub folder respectively.

Each sub folder contains .Rmd source code and output pdf file, all the data files involving in codes are present in [Simulation_results_data](https://github.com/qianfeng2/detREC_program/tree/master/Supplementary_material/Simulation_results_data). For general readers, please look through pdf files only; if you want to investigate more detailedly, take a look at source code.

Enjoy!
