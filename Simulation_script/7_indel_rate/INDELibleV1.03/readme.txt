If the text files look strange on WINDOWS, please open them in WORDPAD, not NOTEPAD!!

Thank you for downloading INDELible V1.03

The folder bin contains executables for Windows and Mac OS-X (intel & G4).

To run type "bin/indelible" once you have navigated to the INDELible folder.

The help folder contains the manual and tutorial from the website.

The src folder contains the source code and compilation instructions.

If you have a question, want to check if there is a newer version of INDELible, 
or want to report a bug then please go to:

http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/indelible/

Please note that if I discover small bugs that do not affect simulation output
then I will just fix them and not release a new version of INDELible.

If bugs are uncovered that may affect simulation output then I will fix them and 
release a new version e.g. V1.01, V1.02 and so on.

Therefore, please make sure to check back at the web address above for any
new version of the program before embarking on complicated/long simulations!

Thank you and enjoy!

WF.
