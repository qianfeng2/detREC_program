Please note that this data should be the same for all simulation settings.

For the purpose of simplicity, I only put the data folder in the first factor folder: 1_proportion_recombinant_seq.

If you want to reproduce all simulation results for remaining factors, please directly copy this data folder to other factor folders: eg, 2_average_number_recombination, 3_data_size...
